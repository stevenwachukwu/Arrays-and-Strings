# Arrays-and-Strings
1 Goals
· Create parallel arrays.

· Populate the array with data using a loop.

· Calculate statistics on the data in the array using some simple operations of C++.

· Print the data and some additional information based on the calculations.

2 Program Requirements
Your assignment is to create a program that does the following:

Create a set of parallel arrays, each pair with the same index go together. a[i] and b[i] contain related data.
a. The first array has 15 characters. This array will hold the ID of a player, give it a logical name.

b. The second array has 15 integers. This array will hold the score of each player, it also needs a logical name.

Write a loop to allow the user to put data in the arrays. The prompt should ask for the ID and score on the same line. The user should enter the data like this: A 21

Write a loop to print the data in from the two arrays in a table format. For example:

ID     Score
A      15
B      21
C      12
Etc.
Next create a loop to calculate the following:
a. Determine the mean and mode of this set of scores. Save this information.

b. Identify the top three scoring players and their scores.

Write a loop to print the data from the two arrays in a table format but add a third column for results. The data can be sorted or in the original order.
a. Identify the top three scorers as Winner (first place), Second Place, Third Place.

b. Identify all other players with scores that are above the mean as “above average”.

c. At the bottom print the average (mean) score and the mode.

For example:

ID     Score     Results
A      15     Second Place  
B      21      Winner
C      12      Above Average
etc.
The mean is 11, and the mode of these scores is 12.

Your code should be modular as follows: 
i. One function can take user input and store it in the array.

ii. Another function can print the contents of the array.

iii. Another function can do the calculations on the data in the array.
